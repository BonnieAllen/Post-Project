Post-Project
____________________________________________
Building this twitter/micropost-esque rails application, using a book and notes as refrences, is a part of the process of increasing muscle memory when it comes to routing and explaining the MVC model. 

The main purpose of building this application is to interpret the code in routes, constructing routes, and talking about them. Building this application is the prerequisite to building a post application without the  assistance of books, notes or refrences.
